# Welcome to the KTP App!

This is a tutorial on how to set up the KTP Project.

To begin, make sure you have [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). 

Then, make sure you install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

Now you may clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/thomas211738/KTP_Activities.git
```

Then, open the repository in Visual Studio Code and open this directory. 

We now need to install the dependencies and packages we need to run our code. In the terminal, run:
```
sudo npm install -g expo-cli
npm install expo
```

Finally, to open the code on your phone you are going to need to install the [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) app. Once you have install the app you can run `npx expo start` which will give you a QR code. It may also ask you to install some packages, so if it does say yes. 

If you have any questions, please ask Thomas.
